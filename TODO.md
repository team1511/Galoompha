#### TODO

As if we'd ever get to even half of this.

1. Restructure to answer the question: what about subsystem's periodic functions. Subsystem->process() ?
1. Add climber subsystem - it should be trivial, up, down, mid sensors; broken switch
1. Add debug buttons: commands linked to each button, access dummy/wrapper Debug subsystem
1. Add light subsystem - feed light
1. Refactor. Again.
1. Add autonomous mode selectors; maybe build a plugin for sfx?? ruby is a nice language...
